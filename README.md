## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository documents my journey learning C programming, algorithms, and data structures. It serves as both a personal reference and a learning resource for others interested in computer science fundamentals.

## 💡 Purpose

- **Learn C from the ground up** - Understanding memory management, pointers, and low-level operations
- **Master fundamental data structures** - Implementing and understanding the building blocks of software
- **Explore algorithm design** - Developing problem-solving skills through practical implementation
- **Document the learning process** - Creating a resource that evolves with my understanding

## 🛠️ What's Inside

This repository contains implementations of various data structures, algorithms, and programming exercises in C. The code is organized to facilitate learning and experimentation.

## 🧪 Running the Code

Examples and implementations can be compiled using a C compiler:

```bash
# Compile
gcc -o program_name file_name.c

# Run
./program_name
```

## 📚 Learning Resources

Some excellent resources for learning C programming and data structures:

- "The C Programming Language" by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie
- "Data Structures and Algorithms in C" by Adam Drozdek
- [Harvard's CS50 Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/)
- [GeeksforGeeks C Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/)

## 📝 Notes

- This is a learning repository - code may be refactored and improved over time
- Feel free to explore, fork, and experiment with the implementations
- Suggestions and discussions about improvements are welcome
